ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @IsaacCepasDeFrutos, and I am a professional currently transitioning into multiplatform application development.
I am in the final stages of completing my studies as a Technician in Cross-Platform Application Development.
After a successful but not entirely fulfilling career as a head chef, I decided to pursue what has always been my passion.

I love development and I am always eager to learn more about it. I also have a strong interest in cybersecurity and systems, especially when it comes to working with Linux.
When I began studying Cross-Platform Development, I decided to use Ubuntu as my main OS because I love challenges and learning new things.
This decision pushed me to learn more about Linux and Bash while I was simultaneously studying development and adjusting to my new OS.
I knew it would be a tough challenge since I had only worked with Windows before, but I took it as a test to prove to myself how capable I am of adapting to new environments and overcoming obstacles.

Thanks to that decision, I discovered a beautiful OS that doesn't treat me like a novice and encourages me to improve myself and truly understand how computers work.
So, thank you so much to the open-source community!

One of the things I enjoyed the most during my studies was participating in a class project where I was responsible for the back-end development. 
My goal was to create a user-friendly experience, which involved implementing real-time checks for form field availability, building the registration page, designing the database (SQL), and preparing the server.
I deployed the web tool using Ubuntu Server, which gave me valuable hands-on experience in server configuration and management.
